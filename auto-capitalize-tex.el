;;; Commentary:

;; This plugin adds TeX support to `auto-capitalize'. It requires `AUCTeX', and
;; it will not work with the builtin `tex-mode'.

;;; Code:

(declare-function TeX-current-macro "ext:tex")
(declare-function TeX-escaped-p "ext:tex")

  "TeX support for auto-capitalize."
  :group 'auto-capitalize)

This predicate blocks capitalization in `TeX-mode' buffers inside of

TEXT-START is ignored; the check uses WORD-START and the buffer content
before it. Specifically, this function returns non-nil if WORD-START
follows the opening brace of a whitelisted TeX macro, i.e. one that's a
member of `auto-capitalize-tex-macro-whitelist', AND the macro itself
sits at a standard capitalization boundary (paragraph start, sentence
start, etc.).

That last check is performed by moving point to the `\\' before the
macro, then calling `auto-capitalize-default-trigger-function'.

This function is added to `auto-capitalize-trigger-functions' when
`auto-capitalize-tex-mode' is enabled."
